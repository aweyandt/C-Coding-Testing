# Goals
Explore and experiment with File Handling in C

# Goals Accomplished
1. Custom Exit Status Function:
   - Devloped a custome function (exit_status) to handle two types of exit codes. This allowed for more flexible and clear error managment

2. File Handling in C
   - Successfully opened a file in read mode (fopen()) and checked if it opened correctly by verifying the file pointer
   - Learned how to read from the file using fgets() to retrieve data line by line and print it to the console.

3. Conditional Program Flow:
   - Incorporated error handling using the custom exit status function. If the file is successfully opened, it reads and prints the content; if not, it handles the error with an appropriate message.
