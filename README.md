# Goals
Explore and experiment to deepen my knowledge and comprehension of C

# Goals Accomplished
1. Custom Exit Status Function:
  * Devloped a custome function (exit_status)) to handle two types of exit codes. This allowed for more flexible and clear error managment

2. File Handling in C
  * Successfully opened a file in read mode (fopen()) and checked if it opened correctly by verifying the file pointer
  * Learned how to read from the file using fgets() to retrieve data line by line and print it to the console.
  
3. Conditional Program Flow:
  * Incorporated error handling using the custom exit status function. If the file is successfully opened, it reads and prints the content; if not, it handles the error with an appropriate message.
